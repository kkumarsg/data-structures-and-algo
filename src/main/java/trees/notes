                         TREES
                         -----

* Trees are used when you want to store hierarchical data.
  Ex : Organization structure
       Folder structures

* Trees are non linear data structures.
* No of children a tree has is degree of a tree.
* XML/HTML is read as a tree in javascript.
* In OOP (Inheritance)

Binary Tree.
    Degree of a node is at most 2.

Tree Traversal.
       Tree traversal is printing every element of a tree.
    1) In order   : left, root, right
    2) Pre order  : root, left, right
    3) Post order : left, right, root
       Remember in all of the orders are in ref to the way root element is present in tree visualization.

Depth First (Recursion) : We go down in depth till we find a leaf node and come.

Remember: All the recursive calls in trees with a auxiliary space of O(Height).
